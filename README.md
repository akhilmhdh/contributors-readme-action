    <h2 align="center">Contributors-Readme-Action</h3>
</p>

Contributors-Readme-Action is a simple GitHub action to automate contributors list in README file. Not only contributors, collborators, bots or any user.

As it uses a GitHub action it's secure and very easy to integrate into your projects. Once added it will automatically add all the repository contributors to your readme in a well-formatted table, including future contributors :smile:. Now why would you need a contributors list? Come on man, show some love to the ones who contribute to your project.:wink:

The contributors list is fetched from [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statistics/).

## Contributors Readme Action Table

Below image shows the contributors table generated by this action.

> You can take it even furthur by mixing it up with bots, custom users and more. Check out the [example](./contributors.md) provided.

## Getting Started

### First Step

If you're new to actions, add these to your `.github/workflows/main.yml` file. If this file does not exist, create one.

```yml
on:
    push:
        branches:
            - main

jobs:
    contrib-readme-job:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        name: A job to automate contrib in readme
        steps:
            - name: Contribute List
              uses: akhilmhdh/contributors-readme-action@v2.3.6
              env:
                  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

That's it!

To add it to your to your existing workflow, **append** this to your current `.yml` workflow script.

```yml
- uses: akhilmhdh/contributors-readme-action@v2.3.6
  env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Second Step

1. Add a `README.md` file
2. Add the below comment inside your `README.md` where you want it to **appear**.

```md
<!-- readme: contributors -start -->
<!-- readme: contributors -end -->
```

3. Save it, wait for the action to complete and tadaa :smile:

### But wait!!!

-   What if you wanted to **add direct collaborators** of a project, no worries

```md
## Collaborators

<!-- readme: collaborators -start -->
<!-- readme: collaborators -end -->

## Contributors

<!-- readme: contributors -start -->
<!-- readme: contributors -end -->
```

-   Now you decided that you want to **join** this into one list, no issue

```md
## Contributors

<!-- readme: collaborators,contributors -start -->
<!-- readme: collaborators,contributors -end -->
```

-   Then you decided to **add some github users** who are important figure in this project and want's to [**remove**](#operators) some users or bots, no worries

```md
## Contributors

<!-- readme: <username1>,collaborators,<username2>,contributors,<username3>/- -start -->
<!-- readme: <username1>,collaborators,<username3>,contributors,<username3>/- -end -->
```

> The order of the list will be given priority. So username1 will appear first collaborators then username2 likewise.(No brackets for usernames)

> The subject inside start and end must be same.

### Comment Styles

If for some reason you do not wish to use HTML style comments `<!-- -->`, you may also use markdown link style comments. 

```md
[//]: # ( readme: collaborators,contributors -start )
[//]: # ( readme: collaborators,contributors -end )
```

Make sure to add `comment_style: "link"` to your workflow.

```yaml
with:
  comment_style: "link"
```

### Keywords

| keywords      | Definition                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| contributors  | contributors of the repo                         |
| collaborators | collaborators of the repo                        |
| sponsors      | sponsors of the repo's user/organization         |
| bots          | bots of the repo                                 |
| username      | any username that you want to add on to the list |

-   [An example of this action can be found here](./contributors.md)

### Operators

Operators are in a nutshell simple modifiers that can be applied to a list like removing a person from a list. They can be applied accordingly to a keyword like `akhilmhdh/-` with a / as seperator.

| operator | Definition                    | Example     |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| /-       | remove the username from list | akhilmhdh/- |

> committer_username and committer_email both must be provided to use as a replacement to GH action committer

> The action will update Readme as PR when the branch is protected, else it will directly commit it.
> But if your branch is protected and you passed personal access token to avoid PR mode by trusting the action, you could set auto_detect_branch_protection to false
